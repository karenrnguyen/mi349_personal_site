<p>
    Hello, my name is Karen Nguyen. I am a senior at Michigan State Univeristy, majoring in Media
    and Information. I am originally from Kentwood, Michigan, a suburb of Grand Rapids. During my
    life before college, I found some hobbies that I loved (and some that I had a love/hate relationship
    with).
</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Some of My Hobbies</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Piano</li>
    <li>Golf</li>
    <li>Marching Band</li>
    <li>Playing Video Games</li>
</ul>

<p>
    My favorite year of marching band, our show was Motown. Even though it wasn't a perfect performance,
    I still have a recording of one of our competitions.
