<p>
    Hello, my name is Karen Nguyen. I am a senior at Michigan State Univeristy, majoring in Media
    and Information. I am originally from Kentwood, Michigan, a suburb of Grand Rapids. During my
    life before college, I found some hobbies that I love, beginning with piano lessons at 7 years
    old.

<p>
    My favorite year of marching band, our show was Motown. This specific show reminds me of such good
    times, that I still have a video from one of our competitions.
